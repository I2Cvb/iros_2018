  Abstract                 = {Navigation technology is an essential ability for the survival and development of animal and human. Navigation sensor plays a key role in exploration, emergency, precision-guided weapons, ship and aircraft navigation and satellites positioning system. The desert ant Cataglyphis is able to explore its desert habitat for hundreds of meters while foraging and return back to its nest precisely and on a straight line. For deriving direction information, this animal uses the pattern of polarized light in the sky that arises due to scattering of sunlight in the atmosphere. The polarization sensitivity mechanisms of the ant's compound eye are analyzed. The work principle of the sensor is discussed. A novel bionic navigation sensor is constructed. And the optic electric structure and the circuits are given. A performance test platform is designed and set up. The character of the dark field and uniform light field are investigated, the static performance about sensitivity, precision are tested in detail. And the non-linearity error is less than 0.0853% \{FSO\} (full-scale output), and the repeatability error with 0.0233% \{FSO\} is achieved. The outdoor experiment is performed under different skylight condition. And the worst angle output error within +- 0.2Â° is achieved. The results indicate the novel navigation sensor is with high precision and robustness.},

We studied the interaction of magnetic, stellar, and twilight orientation cues in free-flying songbirds. We exposed Catharus thrushes to eastward-turned magnetic fields during the twi- light period before takeoff and then followed them for up to 1100 kilometers. Instead of heading north, experimental birds flew westward. On subsequent nights, the same individuals migrated northward again. We suggest that birds orient with a magnetic compass calibrated daily from twilight cues. This could explain how birds cross the magnetic equator and deal with declination.},

  Abstract                 = {Recent advancements in nanotechnology and nanofabrication have allowed for the emergence of the division-of-focal-plane (DoFP) polarization imaging sensors. These sensors capture polarization properties of the optical field at every imaging frame. However, the DoFP polarization imaging sensors suffer from large registration error as well as reduced spatial-resolution output. These drawbacks can be improved by applying proper image interpolation methods for the reconstruction of the polarization results. In this paper, we present a new gradient-based interpolation method for DoFP polarimeters. The performance of the proposed interpolation method is evaluated against several previously published interpolation methods by using visual examples and root mean square error (RMSE) comparison. We found that the proposed gradient-based interpolation method can achieve better visual results while maintaining a lower RMSE than other interpolation methods under various dynamic ranges of a scene ranging from dim to bright conditions.},

  Abstract                 = {Image interpolation and denoising are important techniques in image processing. These methods are inherent to digital image acquisition as most digital cameras are composed of a 2D grid of heterogeneous imaging sensors. Current polarization imaging employ four different pixelated polarization filters, commonly referred to as division of focal plane polarization sensors. The sensors capture only partial information of the true scene, leading to a loss of spatial resolution as well as inaccuracy of the captured polarization information. Interpolation is a standard technique to recover the missing information and increase the accuracy of the captured polarization information. Here we focus specifically on Gaussian process regression as a way to perform a statistical image interpolation, where estimates of sensor noise are used to improve the accuracy of the estimated pixel information. We further exploit the inherent grid structure of this data to create a fast exact algorithm that operates in \&\#x01d4aa;(N3/2) (vs. the naive \&\#x01d4aa;(N3)), thus making the Gaussian process method computationally tractable for image data. This modeling advance and the enabling computational advance combine to produce significant improvements over previously published interpolation methods for polarimeters, which is most pronounced in cases of low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). We provide the comprehensive mathematical model as well as experimental results of the GP interpolation performance for division of focal plane polarimeter.},

Insects, such as desert ants and honeybees, for example, utilize polarized skylight pattern-based information in their navigation activities. They reliably return to their nests and hives from places many kilometers away. The insect navigation system involves the dorsal rim area in their compound eyes and the corresponding polarization sensitive neurons in the brain. The dorsal rim area is equipped with photoreceptors, which have orthogonally arranged small hair-like structures termed microvilli. These are the specialized sensors for the detection of polarized skylight patterns (e-vector orientation). Various research groups have been working on the development of novel navigation systems inspired by polarized skylight-based navigation in animals. Their major contributions are critically reviewed. One focus of current research activities is on imitating the integration path mechanism in desert ants. The potential for simple, high performance miniaturized bioinstrumentation that can assist people in navigation will be explored.},

  Abstract                 = {The ability to navigate in a complex environment is crucial for both animals and robots. Many animals use a combination of different strategies to return to significant locations in their environment. For example, the desert ant Cataglyphis is able to explore its desert habitat for hundreds of meters while foraging and return back to its nest precisely and on a straight line. The three main strategies that Cataglyphis is using to accomplish this task are path integration, visual piloting and systematic search. In this study, we use a synthetic methodology to gain additional insights into the navigation behavior of Cataglyphis. Inspired by the insectâs navigation system we have developed mechanisms for path integration and visual piloting that were successfully employed on the mobile robot Sahabot 2. On the one hand, the results obtained from these experiments provide support for the underlying biological models. On the other hand, by taking the parsimonious navigation strategies of insects as a guideline, computationally cheap navigation methods for mobile robots are derived from the insights gained in the experiments. },

  Abstract                 = {Microgrid polarimeters are composed of an array of micro-polarizing elements overlaid upon an FPA sensor. In the past decade systems have been designed and built in all regions of the optical spectrum. These systems have rugged, compact designs and the ability to obtain a complete set of polarimetric measurements during a single image capture. However, these systems acquire the polarization measurements through spatial modulation and each measurement has a varying instantaneous field-of-view (IFOV). When these measurements are combined to estimate the polarization images, strong edge artifacts are present that severely degrade the estimated polarization imagery. These artifacts can be reduced when interpolation strategies are first applied to the intensity data prior to Stokes vector estimation. Here we formally study IFOV error and the performance of several bilinear interpolation strategies used for reducing it.},

  Abstract                 = {During their spectacular migratory journey in the fall, North American monarch butterflies (Danaus plexippus) use a time-compensated sun compass to help them navigate to their overwintering sites in central Mexico [1â3]. One feature of the sun compass mechanism not fully explored in monarchs is the sunlight-dependent parameters used to navigate. We now provide data suggesting that the angle of polarized skylight (the e-vector) is a relevant orientation parameter. By placing butterflies in a flight simulator outdoors and using a linear polarizing filter, we show that manipulating the e-vector alters predictably the direction of oriented flight. Butterflies studied in either the morning or afternoon showed similar responses to filter rotation. Monarch butterflies possess the anatomical structure needed for polarized skylight detection, as rhabdoms in the dorsalmost row of photoreceptor cells in monarch eye show the organization characteristic of polarized-light receptors. The existence of polarized-light detection could allow migrants to accurately navigate under a variety of atmospheric conditions and reveals a critical input pathway into the sun compass mechanism.},

  Abstract                 = {Viking navigation from Norway to America in the northern latitudes remains a mystery for physicists, historians and archaeologists. Polarimetric methods using absorbing dichroic crystals as polarizers to detect a hidden Sun direction using the polarized skylight have led to controversies. Indeed, these techniques may lack in sensitivity, especially when the degree of polarization is low. Here, we demonstrate theoretically and experimentally that using the transparent common Iceland spar as a depolarizer, the Vikings could have performed a precise navigation under different conditions. Indeed, when simply rotated, such a birefringent crystal can completely depolarize, at the so-called isotropy point, any partially polarized state of light, allowing us to guess the direction of the Sun. By equalizing the intensities of the ordinary and extraordinary beams at the isotropy point, we show that the Sun direction can be determined easily, thanks to a simple sensitive differential two-image observation. A precision of a few degrees could be reached even under dark crepuscular conditions. The exciting recent discovery of such an Iceland spar in the Alderney Elizabethan ship that sank two centuries before the introduction of the polarization of light in optics may support the use of the calcite crystal for navigation purposes.},

  Abstract                 = {Navigation is important both for insects to perform living tasks and robots to perform assigned tasks. We propose a CMOS image sensor for autonomous agent navigation which mimicks the navigational patterns of insects using the variations in the degree of skylight polarization. The polarization pattern of the skylight varies in a systematic way both in the plane (e-vector) and the degree of polarization according to the sun's position. The proposed CMOS image sensor is able to sense polarization information in real time using a metallic wire grid micro-polarizer oriented in various directions on top of the pixel. The degree of polarization is computed from the sensed polarization information, the variations of which can be used as a compass. The image sensor consist of an array of 128Ã128 pixels, occupies an area of 5Ã4mm2 and it has been designed and fabricated in a 180nm CMOS process.},
