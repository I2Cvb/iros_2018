\section{Discussion and Conclusion}
\label{sec:dis-con}

This paper presents the primary results of our attitude estimation using
polarimetric camera on the generated synthetic data.  Two sets of data were
generated one considering optimal and another noisy (more realistic)
conditions. In order to cope with the undesired artifacts and outliers in the
measurements, we integrated a ransac model in our framework which resulted in a
satisfactory performance.
