\section{Discussion and Conclusion}
\label{sec:dis-con}

This paper presents the results of our attitude estimation using polarimetric
camera and skylight polarized pattern.  The proposed algorithm was tested using
real and synthetic data.  In order to cope with the undesired artifacts and
outliers in the measurements, we integrated a ransac model in our framework.
Promising results were achieved after using ransac optimization.  However,
certainly, there is room for improvements for instance minimizing the
accumulated error of prediction using a filter.  Nevertheless, in this paper we
presented the potential and capacity of a polarimetric camera and polarized
information to be integrated in the robotic field.

As a future works, as presented in \cite{hamaoui2017polarized}, we would like
to integrate the use of \gls{dopl} for attitude estimation and assess the
performance of the polarimetric camera in combination of traditional sensors.
