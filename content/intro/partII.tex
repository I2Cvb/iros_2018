\section{Polarized cues used for attitude estimation}
\label{sec:pcues}
To understand the polarized cues that are used for attitude estimation, three
main concepts are covered in this section: (i) the Rayleigh scattering model and
interesting aspects of polarization by scattering, (ii) the polarization
parameters in pixel frame and its relation to camera, and (iii) the
relationship between the polarized parameters in the pixel frame and other
parameters for attitude estimation.
% solar zenith: angle between the zenith and the center of the sun disk $\theta_s$
% solar elevation: altitude of the sun, angle between the horizon and the
% center of the sun disk $\alpha_s$
% solar azimuth: direction of the sun $\phi_s$, while $\theta_s, \alpha_s$
% define how high is the sun
% scattering angle $\lambda$: angular distance between the observed celestial
% point and the sun
% solar meridian: plane containing the sun and the observer
% Scattering plane: plane of observer,  celestial point observed and the sun
% Rayleigh model- direction of polarization is perpendicular to the scattering
% plane

\subsection{Rayleigh scattering model}
\label{subsec:rayleigh}
The unpolarized sunlight passing through our atmosphere gets scattered by
different particles within the atmosphere.  Beside deviating the direction of
propagate wave, this transition also changes the polarization state of the
incident light. This transition can be explained using Rayleigh scattering
model.  Rayleigh scattering describes the scattering of light or any
electromagnetic waves by particles much smaller than their transmission
wavelength. Accordingly it assumes that scattering particles of the atmosphere
are small, homogeneous particles much smaller than the wavelength of the
sunlight.  Despite its simplification and assumption, this model proved to be
sufficient for describing skylight scattering and polarization
patterns~\cite{pomozi2001clearsky, horvath2002ground}.

The Rayleigh model predicts that the unpolarized sunlight becomes linearly
polarized after being scattered by the atmosphere. Based on this model two
main outcomes are drawn. On the one hand, the Degree of linear Polarization is
directly linked to the scattering angle ($\gamma$) according to:

\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:3}
  \rho_{l} = \rho_{l_{max}}\frac{1 - \cos^{2}(\gamma)}{1 + \cos^{
      2}(\gamma)}
\end{equation}

where $\rho_{l_{max}}$ is a constant that should be equal to 1 in theory but in practice
the constant is slightly less than 1 due to some atmospheric disturbances\cite{pomozi2001clearsky}.
The scattering angle $\gamma$ is defined by the angle between the observed celestial vector $\vec{c}$ and the sun
vector $\vec{s}$ as presented Fig.~\ref{fig:scattering}. It can be noticed that
the Degree of Polarization is 0 in the sun direction and maximum when the scattering angle is $\pi/2$.
\cite{smith2007polarization, miyazaki09sunlightpolarization}.

On the other hand, the scattered light is considered to be polarized and
orthogonal to the scattering plane.  Consequently, the Angle of Polarization is
directly related to the orientation of the scattering plane.

  by light shade of red. ($\theta_s$, $\phi_s$) and ($\theta_c$, $\phi_c$)
  define the zenith and azimuth angle of sun and celestial point
  respectively. $\widehat{obc}$ defines the pixel frame, $\mathcal{P}$, and
  $\vec{E}$ is the electrical field orthogonal to the scattering plane.}
    \label{fig:scattering}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Polarization by scattering model in pixel frame}
\label{subsec:pscattering}
As presented Fig.~\ref{fig:pixelframe}, an image is considered as a collection
of pixels, and each pixel measures the polarization parameters of the light
travelling along a ray associated with that pixel. The pixel frame
$\mathcal{P}$ is defined accordingly with the ray which coincides with
$\vec{c}$. The camera calibration determines the relationship between pixels
and these 3D rays.

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[scale=0.8]{./content/intro/figures/pixelframe.pdf}
  \caption{Rotation between the camera frame $\mathcal{C}$ and one pixel frame $\mathcal{P}$. The light ray associated to the pixels are represented in dark orange. The pixel that corresponds to the center of the image has obiously the same frame as the camera.}
    \label{fig:pixelframe}
\end{figure}

Let's consider one pixel of the image with its associated pixel frame $\mathcal{P}$ ($\widehat{obc}$).
Based on Rayleigh scattering the electric field of incident light after
scattering is perpendicular to the scattering plane, that is defined by the
observer, celestial point and the sun.
Accordingly the normalized electric field vector $\vec{E}$ in the world frame
is presented as the normalized cross product of $\vec{s}$ and
$\vec{c}$ (see Eq.~\ref{Eq:E}).

\begin{equation}
\vec{E}=\frac{\vec{s}\wedge \vec{c}}{\left\Vert \vec{s}\wedge
    \vec{c}\right\Vert }
\label{Eq:E}
\end{equation}

The same measure in the pixel frame $\mathcal{P}$  is represented as:
% However measuring the skylight polarization pattern and \gls{aop}, the electric
% field in the pixel frame $\mathcal{P}$ ($\widehat{obc}$) is represented as:

\begin{equation}
E_{obc}=\left[\begin{array}{l}
E_{o}\\
E_{b}\\
0
\end{array}\right]=\left[\begin{array}{l}
\cos\alpha\\
\sin\alpha\\
0
\end{array}\right]
\label{Eq:Eproj}
\end{equation}
\noindent where $\alpha$ is the measured \gls{aop} associated to the corresponding pixel.
Combination of Eq.~\ref{Eq:E}~\&~\ref{Eq:Eproj} and using the
scattering angle $\gamma$, between $\vec{s}$ and $\vec{c}$ leads to:
\begin{equation}
  \begin{cases}
(s\wedge c)\cdot o & =\sin\gamma\cos\alpha\\
(s\wedge c)\cdot b & =\sin\gamma\sin\alpha
\end{cases}
\label{eq:E0EB vect-1-1}
\end{equation}

\noindent applying vector triplet cross product rule on Eq.~\ref{eq:E0EB
  vect-1-1} results.
\begin{equation}
\begin{cases}
s\cdot b & =\sin\gamma\cos\alpha\\
s\cdot o & =-\sin\gamma\sin\alpha
\end{cases}
\label{eq:scal-b-o}
\end{equation}
Using Eq.~\ref{eq:3}, the scattering angle $\gamma$, therefore can be
represented as:
\begin{equation}
\cos\gamma=s\cdot c=\pm\sqrt{\frac{1-\rho_{l}'}{1+\rho_{l}'}}
\label{Eq:cosg}
\end{equation}
\noindent with $\rho_{l}'=\frac{\rho_{l}}{\rho_{l_{max}}}.$ \\
\vspace{0.4mm}
%\vskip{0.1mm}

Equations~\ref{eq:scal-b-o}~\&~\ref{Eq:cosg} finally leads to a representation of the sun vector
in pixel frame $\mathcal{P}$ which express a direct relation between the
\gls{aop}, the scattering angle and the sun position:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:sunp}
  \vec{s}_{p} =
    \begin{bmatrix}
    -\sin\gamma \sin\alpha\\
    \sin\gamma \cos\alpha\\
    \cos\gamma
  \end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}
In another word, the sun vector is expressed in the pixel frame as a vector depending only on the polarization parameters \gls{aop} and \gls{dopl} (which is directly linked to the scattering angle $\gamma$).

\subsection{UAV attitude and polarized sky pattern}
\label{subsec:ps-attitude}
To derive equations applicable in attitude estimation process, all rotations matrices that describe the frame change
must be taken into considerations. The overview of the considered scenario, the frame conventions and rotations
for an \gls{uav} is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:rotation}. The \gls{imu} frame was added for comparisons purposes.

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{./content/intro/figures/conventions.pdf}
  \caption{Frame conventions and rotations for attitude estimation of an
    \gls{uav}}
  \label{fig:rotation}
\end{figure}
In Fig.~\ref{fig:rotation} the $\mathcal{W}, \mathcal{W'}, \mathcal{I},
\mathcal{V}, \mathcal{C},$ and $\mathcal{P}$, present the world frame, global
frame of \gls{imu}, \gls{imu} frame, vehicle frame, camera frame, and pixel
frame respectively. Where the rotation from each frame to another is presented
with lowercase alphabet.
In the shown scenario, a vector $v_{p}$ in pixel frame is
expressed in the world frame, $v_{w}$:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:vinW}
  v_{w} = R_{wv} \cdot R_{vc} \cdot R_{cp} \cdot v_{p}
\end{equation}
\noindent where the rotation from the camera to the pixel frame $R_{cp}$ is
obtained by camera calibration. The rotation is
defined as the yaw and pitch rotation by the zenith and azimuth angle of the
celestial point ($\theta_c, \phi_c$) as shown in Eq.~\ref{eq:Rcp}.
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:Rcp}
  \begin{split}
  R_{cp}  & =
  \begin{bmatrix}
    \cos\theta_{c}\cos\phi_{c} & -\sin\phi_{c} & \sin\theta_{c}\cos\phi_{c}\\
    \cos\theta_{c}\sin\phi_{c} & \cos\phi_{c} & \sin\theta_{c}\sin\phi_{c}\\
    -\sin\theta_{c} & 0 & \cos\theta_{c}
  \end{bmatrix}
  \\
  & = R_{z_{c}}(\phi_{c})\cdot R_{y_{c}}(\theta_{c})
  \end{split}
\end{equation}

Previously we presented how to express sun position in pixel frame (see
Eq.~\ref{eq:sunp}). Indeed this representation is applied to any point from
world frame, ergo:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:Rwv}
  \begin{split}
    s_{w} & = R_{wv} \cdot R_{vc} \cdot R_{cp} \cdot
    \begin{bmatrix}
    -\sin\gamma \sin\alpha\\
    \sin\gamma \cos\alpha\\
    \cos\gamma
  \end{bmatrix} = R_{wv} \cdot R_{vc} \cdot v\\
    & R^{T} \cdot s_{w}  = v
  \end{split}
\end{equation}

The above equation shows a direct relationship between the rotation matrix of the vehicle $R$,
the angle of polarization~$\alpha$(that can be measured by the polarimetric camera at one pixel) and the
angle of scattering $\gamma$ for the corresponding pixel. In addition, if $\rho_{lmax}$ is known,
the angle of scattering could be directly obtained by inverting equation~\ref{Eq:cosg} providing a direct relation
between polarization parameters and the rotation of the vehicle.
